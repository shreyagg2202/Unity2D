  storyText: 'You hear some knocking on your door and see that your 2 friends came
    to visit you. You have some fun with both of them while cursing them both in
    your mind because both of them are only there to steal something or the other
    from your room.

    

    While they are leaving you see a gun on your side
    table.

    

    What would you do?

    

    1. Ask them if that gun belongs
    to them.

    

    2. Hide the gun and wait for them to leave. '
