  storyText: 'You pick up the gun and start inspecting it if its real or not. You
    realize that it is the same gun that was in your room before but this time it
    had a button on it. You press the button and the gun transforms into a sniper
    and suddenly your senses get sharpened and you can also feel your legs again.
    you pick up the sniper and start shooting weird creatures far away and in this
    way basic game mechanics will be taught to you.


    Press ''1'' if you want
    to play again.'
